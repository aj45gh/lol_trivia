microservices
- champion info api
- item info api
- loldle clone
- winrate lower/higher
- shopkeeper's quiz clone
- random champion

Plan:
1) Admin interface for champion CRUD
2) Homepage with links to trivia games
3) Use ORM
4) Get updated champ info via API/web scraping
5) Routes file?
6) Implement services to keep controllers lean
7) Base template
